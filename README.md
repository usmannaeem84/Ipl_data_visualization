# 🏏 IPL Data Visualization Project

This project explores and visualizes IPL (Indian Premier League) match data to uncover patterns in team performances, toss outcomes, individual records, venues, and winning margins. Using Python and popular visualization libraries, I created insightful charts to better understand match dynamics and standout players.
